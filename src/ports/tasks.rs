//! The [`TaskStore`] port: the company's durable Kanban board.
//!
//! Tasks are the operator-visible work items the console's board renders
//! (backlog / in-progress / in-review / done). They are hand-curated state, not
//! cycle working memory — the brain's per-cycle task results live in
//! [`MemoryStore`](crate::ports::MemoryStore). Each record is keyed by a stable
//! id within the company.
