//! The [`CompanyRuntime`] assembly: one running company's wired-together ports.
//!
//! The struct matches the sketch in `docs/spec/runtime/ports.md` — the nine
//! ports, with `economy` the only optional one. Three runtime-internal fields
//! are added: the company `id`, a per-company serial lock so exactly one cycle
//! runs at a time, and the [`RuntimeJournal`] backing at-most-once effects and
//! the durable approval queue.
//!
//! The cycle logic itself lives in [`CycleRunner`](crate::runtime::CycleRunner);
//! the methods here are thin delegations so callers hold a single
//! `Arc<CompanyRuntime>`.
