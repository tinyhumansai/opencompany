//! Brain-agnostic delegation seam (issue #176, slice 1).
//!
//! Delegation — opening board tasks, handing a turn to a desk's lead member, and
//! the CEO-relay hand-back — used to live wired directly into
//! [`HarnessBrain`](crate::harness::brain::HarnessBrain), hard-coupled to the
//! [`HarnessPool`](crate::harness::HarnessPool). This module lifts that
//! orchestration out behind the [`RunTurn`] trait so a later slice can give the
//! hosted Medulla brain the same delegation without duplicating it.
//!
//! Slice 1 is a behaviour-preserving refactor: the harness path stays
//! byte-for-byte equivalent — [`HarnessBrain`](crate::harness::brain::HarnessBrain)
//! now drives a [`DelegationRunner`] over a
//! [`HarnessRunTurn`](crate::harness::run_turn::HarnessRunTurn) (the trait impl
//! that re-attaches [`HarnessDeps`](crate::harness::HarnessDeps)).
//!
//! Compiled only under `feature = "openhuman"`: [`TurnOutcome`] and the
//! delegation queue the runner drains are harness types. Slice 2 will generalise
//! the trait's turn types so a non-harness brain can implement it.
