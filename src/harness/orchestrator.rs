//! The company **orchestrator**: the operator↔company chat as a first-class
//! delegating agent.
//!
//! Where the harness brain's default chat responder is just the first roster
//! agent, the orchestrator is the one place the operator asks anything and it
//! answers from whole-company context — grounding replies in the company's
//! durable facts and recent activity, and delegating work it should not do
//! itself. It is the roster agent whose manifest `tier = "orchestrator"`, or the
//! first agent when none is tagged (so a company without an orchestrator behaves
//! exactly as before).
//!
//! It reaches six tools, all wired only onto the orchestrator agent:
//!
//! * [`QueryCompanyTool`] — a read surface over the company's [`FactStore`] and
//!   recent [`EventLog`] history.
//! * [`SpawnTaskTool`] / [`DelegateToDeskTool`] — delegation tools that push a
//!   [`Delegation`] onto a shared [`DelegationQueue`]. They perform no work
//!   themselves; the [`HarnessBrain`](crate::harness::HarnessBrain) drains the
//!   queue after the orchestrator's turn (v1: synchronous, in-cycle, capped at
//!   [`MAX_DELEGATIONS_PER_TURN`], no sub-agent re-delegation).
//! * [`RunWorkflowTool`] — executes one of the company's saved workflow graphs
//!   by id via the [`WorkflowRunner`] port (issue #67). It loads the graph from
//!   the company source directory (the same loader the REST run route uses) and
//!   invokes the runner reached through a shared [`WorkflowRunnerHandle`], so a
//!   task waiting on a workflow can actually be run to completion. Unlike the
//!   delegation tools it runs the graph inline and returns a concise summary of
//!   the run rather than enqueuing deferred work.
//! * [`CreateWorkflowTool`] (issue #112) — authors and saves a brand-new
//!   workflow graph through the same validated-persist core the console
//!   `POST .../workflows` route runs, so the orchestrator can capture a
//!   repeatable process mid-chat; it lands enabled and runnable by
//!   [`RunWorkflowTool`] the same turn.
//! * [`AddAgentTool`] (issue #71) — writes a new [`OverlayAgent`] through the
//!   same store path the console `POST .../team` route uses, so the
//!   orchestrator can bring on a teammate mid-chat.
//!
//! Compiled only under `feature = "openhuman"` (the whole `harness` module is).

company's durable facts, recent activity, saved workflows, and team roster — it is the source of \
truth for what workflows exist and who is on the team, so consult it before answering \"what \
workflows/teammates do we have?\" rather than guessing or naming a skill \
— `delegate_to_desk` to hand a turn to a desk's lead \
member, `spawn_task` to open a tracked task card, `run_workflow` to execute one of the \
company's saved workflows by id (for example to advance or finish a task that is waiting on a \
workflow run) — you can run workflows yourself; never claim the run_workflow tool is unavailable — \
`create_workflow` to author and save a brand-new workflow graph (a trigger plus agent / tool / \
condition / output steps) when a repeatable process is worth capturing — it's enabled immediately \
and runnable with run_workflow — and `add_agent` to bring on a new teammate (a name, role, and \
optional mandate) when the company genuinely needs one — it becomes a real, addressable member of \
the team starting next turn. \
Delegate, run or create a workflow, or add a teammate only when it genuinely helps — otherwise \
answer directly and concisely."
